# API Security Best Practices

To prevent vulnerabilities in APIs, it's essential to focus on security from the beginning. Here are some simple steps:

## 1. Secure API Documentation
- **Keep API documentation private** if it's not meant for public use.
- **Update documentation regularly** so legitimate users know the API's capabilities and restrictions.

## 2. Use an Allowlist for HTTP Methods
- Only allow certain methods (like `GET`, `POST`) to be used by the API. This limits potential misuse of methods like `DELETE` or `PATCH` unless necessary.

## 3. Validate Content Types
- Always check the content type of incoming requests (like JSON or XML). Make sure it matches what you expect, and block unexpected content types (e.g., HTML).

## 4. Use Generic Error Messages
- When something goes wrong, don’t provide detailed error messages. Use generic ones to avoid giving attackers clues about the API's internal workings.

## 5. Protect All API Versions
- Don’t just secure the latest version of your API. Ensure all active versions are protected, as attackers might target older versions.

## Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities

### What is Mass Assignment?
Mass assignment happens when an API allows users to send data that modifies properties they shouldn’t have access to, like changing their account privileges.

### How to Prevent Mass Assignment:

- **Allow users to update only safe properties** like their username or email address.
- **Block sensitive properties** (e.g., `isAdmin`, `role`) from being updated by users, ensuring they can't modify things they shouldn't have access to.
